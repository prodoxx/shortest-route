A small project I worked on for my Algorithm Final Project while attaining my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

An algorithm was created to find the shorest-route to from Point A to Point L. The project illustrates this visually. 
Two files were provided in this respository called AdacencyMatrix.txt (helps to draw the graph) and ListOfPoints.txt (helps to draw the points in the graph).

The algorithm is not perfect but this project can remain here as a reference for anyone who is trying to do something like this.
